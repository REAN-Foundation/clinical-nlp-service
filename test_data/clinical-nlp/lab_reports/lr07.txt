HCG was 3820. Hemoglobin was 11.6. Clean-catch urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase, too numerous to count white blood cells and few bacteria. Transvaginal ultrasound showed no adnexal masses, no free fluid in the cul-de-sac, 1.3 cm fluid collection in the endometrial cavity with no yolk sac or a fetal pole. This collection could represent an early intrauterine pregnancy but cannot definitely exclude ectopic pregnancy, although no masses were seen in the adnexa.
