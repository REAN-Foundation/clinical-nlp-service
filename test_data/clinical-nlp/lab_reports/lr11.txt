WBC 6.2, hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 32.8 and platelets 190,000. Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, BUN 7, creatinine 0.7, glucose 204. UA negative. Cholesterol 90, triglycerides 60, HDL 32, LDL 46, VLDL 12. A1c 5.5. Procalcitonin less than 0.5. TSH 1.10. Cardiac enzymes have all been negative. CTA of the circle of Willis showed an ulcerated plaque in the proximal right internal carotid artery with no significant stenosis, occlusion of the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery, a severe stenosis of the cavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery. Chest x-ray showed satisfactory PICC placement, hazy infiltrate, left upper lobe, may represent pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting. MRI of the head without contrast and MRA showed distal left anterior cerebral artery territory infarct, old lacunar changes in the brain and brainstem, very abnormal circle of Willis. Carotid ultrasound showed atherosclerosis without hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis, retrograde flow in the right vertebral artery. Echocardiogram showed a mild diffuse hypokinesis in the left ventricle. The left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly reduced, 45-50%. There is severe grade 3 to 4 diastolic dysfunction, reversible restrictive pattern of mitral inflow. There is mild to moderate regurgitation, 1 to 2+. There is moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Estimation of right ventricular systolic pressure is not possible. There is a small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
