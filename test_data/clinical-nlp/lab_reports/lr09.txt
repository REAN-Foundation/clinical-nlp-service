Laboratory tests during this hospitalization showed the patient to have, as stated before, low sodium with sodium of 124. This low sodium was noted to resolve and the number did improve throughout the hospitalization. The patient had normal BUN with creatinine between 1.1 and 1.2. The patient had total cholesterol of 240 with HDL of 138 and an LDL of 88. Cardiac enzymes were negative for myocardial infarction. B-type natriuretic peptide was slightly elevated at 120 with normal being between 0 and 100. CK-MB fractions were negative. Amylase as well as lipase were both within normal limits. Iron was 60. Urine sodium was low at 22. CA-125 was normal at 21.2. Alpha-fetoprotein was normal at 7.5. TSH was normal at 3.7. CEA was normal at 0.6. Folic acid was normal at 7.4. Vitamin B12 level was normal at 528. Hepatitis viral profile was negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and hepatitis C. Urine osmolality was low at 148 with blood osmolality normal at 263. Urinalysis was negative for finding of urinary tract infection. Hemoglobin was ranging between 9.7 and 8.7, with the lowest being 8.7 on MM/DD/YYYY. This number did improve throughout the hospitalization. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal with no hemoglobin variation. The patient had an MRI of the brain performed, which showed no acute ischemia identified. There is mild age-related chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Noncontrast CAT scan of the head showed no evidence of acute infarct. There was no mass effect or midline shift. Chest x-ray showed eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound showed fatty liver changes and normal gallbladder. CAT scan of the abdomen performed showed liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, and pancreas was unremarkable. The spleen was normal in size. There were no adrenal lesions. The kidneys were normal in size. There was no renal calcification seen. There was no hydronephrosis. There was no evidence of any retroperitoneal bleeding. The CAT scan of the pelvis performed showed what appeared to be routine IUD in place. There was right colonic diverticuli. Echocardiogram performed showed preserved left ventricular systolic function with evidence of possible diastolic compliance changes. There was trivial valvular flow abnormality. There was no gross mural thrombi or vegetations.
